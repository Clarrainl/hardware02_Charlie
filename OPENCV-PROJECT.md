# Blueprint Analyzer with OpenCV

This project introduces architecture students to the basics of OpenCV through a practical exercise in image processing. The program processes blueprint images, highlights walls and room boundaries, and calculates areas of detected rooms. Itâ€™s designed for beginners to learn Python and OpenCV while applying programming skills to an architecture-related task.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, students will:

- Learn the basics of OpenCV for image processing.
- Understand how to load, display, and manipulate images in Python.
- Use edge detection and contour analysis to extract shapes from images.
- Perform calculations like area measurement based on image data.

## Features
1. **Load and Display Blueprint**
   - Load a blueprint image from a file.
   - Display the image in a separate window.

2. **Convert to Grayscale**
   - Convert the image to grayscale to simplify processing.

3. **Edge Detection**
   - Use Canny Edge Detection to highlight walls and boundaries.

4. **Contour Detection**
   - Identify closed areas (like rooms) using contours.
   - Highlight these contours on the original image.

5. **Calculate Room Areas**
   - Approximate and display the area of detected rooms in square pixels.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have Python installed on your system and the OpenCV library.

### Installation
Install OpenCV using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Save the Python script as `blueprint_analyzer.py`.
3. Run the program from the terminal:

   ```bash
   python blueprint_analyzer.py
   ```

4. Provide the path to a sample blueprint image (e.g., a JPEG or PNG file) when prompted.

## Example Workflow
```plaintext
Enter the path to the blueprint image: blueprint.jpg

-- Displays the following windows --
1. Original Blueprint
2. Edges (processed image)
3. Outlined Blueprint (detected room contours)

-- Console Output --
Contour 0: Area = 1200.50 square pixels
Contour 1: Area = 800.75 square pixels
...
```

## Expansion Ideas
- **Unit Conversion**: Convert pixel-based areas to real-world units (e.g., square feet) by specifying a scale.
- **Interactive Room Selection**: Allow users to click on specific rooms to calculate or highlight areas.
- **Save Processed Image**: Save the image with highlighted contours to a file.
- **Color Segmentation**: Differentiate between walls, doors, and furniture based on color.

## Sample Blueprint Images
You can use any simple blueprint image (JPEG/PNG). For example:
- Images of floor plans with clear walls and rooms.
- Hand-drawn sketches converted to digital formats.
