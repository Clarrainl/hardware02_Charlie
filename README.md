# Learn Python and OpenCV through hands on projects

This repo is used for IAAC students and faculty to learn Python and OpenCV through projects. Navigate to either the `PYTHON-PROJECT.md` or the `OPENCV-PROJECT.md` to get started. 

The concepts and tools learned through the hands on work you put buidling these projects are fundamental for future python and opencv development.

This repo is designed for the preparation of MRAC students as they are entering the second term of the MRAC programme which is dedicated to *sensing*.

# Debugging Tips for Python and OpenCV Projects

Here are some practical debugging tips for students tackling Python and OpenCV projects:

## General Python Debugging Tips

1. **Understand the Error Message**:
   - Read error messages carefully; they often indicate the exact problem (e.g., syntax errors, missing libraries, or type mismatches).
   - Use the stack trace to locate the line of code causing the error.
   - Copy and paste the error onto google; many times the answer can be found immediately.

2. **Print Statements**:
   - Use `print()` statements to display the values of variables at different stages of the program to understand what's happening.

3. **Check Inputs**:
   - Verify that inputs (e.g., file paths, numbers) are correct and in the expected format.

4. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - Test small sections of the code in isolation to ensure they work before integrating them into the larger program.
